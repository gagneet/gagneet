## Hi there 👋 - I'm Gagneet Singh - DevOps & Test Automation Lead

Let's Start with the Tech Blog & [Live Long and Prosper](http://gagneet.com/)

I'm a **DevOps and Test Automation Lead** with 20+ years of experience building scalable systems, leading enterprise automation initiatives, and driving innovation through efficient development practices. I'm an Automation, Performance and Security testing expert 💻, Love publishing pics I took 📸, and an electronic hobbyist 🎨!

## 🚀 My Philosophy & Approach

I believe in empowering teams through comprehensive automation strategies that span from infrastructure provisioning to security testing. My approach combines deep technical expertise in test automation with modern DevOps practices, focusing on creating resilient, scalable systems that enable rapid, secure deployments. I love the entire process of developing and creating innovative ideas to be lazy. Having worked across enterprise environments at Microsoft, Yahoo, Adobe, and Oracle, I bring a unique perspective on scaling automation across diverse technology stacks.

## ✨ Guiding Principles

- **"Automation Over Repetition"**: If a process can be automated, it should be. Manual work is technical debt waiting to happen.
- **"Security by Design, Not by Chance"**: Security considerations must be integrated from architecture through deployment, not retrofitted later.
- **"Fail Fast, Learn Faster"**: Embrace rapid feedback loops through comprehensive monitoring and observability to catch issues early when they're cheapest to fix.
- **"People First, Tools Second"**: The best technology stack means nothing without empowered engineering teams who understand the why behind the what.
